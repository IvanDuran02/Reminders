# Todo:
- Commands: (reminders) reminders
    - start-shift: Start a timer
    - end-shift: stops the timer
    - pause-timer: pauses the timer (Pause might cut into next break? doesn't have to be so strict though...)
    - check-duration: Checks current timer status
    - next-break: checks time until next break
    - skip-activity: skips the activity
    - skip-break: skips the break

## Schduler
- When logging on for the day run a command (ex. start-shift) which will start a timer that will send notifications to do activites every so often. There will be a command to skip an activity or break
